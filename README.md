Setup
=====

We're using Java 1.8 so add the following to your `~/.mavenrc` to build properly, of course after install the 1.8 JDK.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_25.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Install `apache-flume` version `1.5.2` as well as `apache-hbase` version `hbase-0.98.8-hadoop2`.

For now we will use Redis.
